this calculator allows a user to input two numbers and then it gives the sum, difference, division, product
# Fun Calculator 🎉

A simple and interactive Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers with a fun twist! 😊

## Features ✨

- **Addition** ➕: Adds two numbers
- **Subtraction** ➖: Subtracts the second number from the first
- **Multiplication** ✖️: Multiplies two numbers
- **Division** ➗: Divides the first number by the second (watch out for division by zero!)

## How to Use 🚀

1. Run the Python script in your terminal or IDE.
2. Enter the first number when prompted.
3. Enter the second number when prompted.
4. The calculator will display:
   - Sum of the numbers
   - Difference between the numbers
   - Product of the numbers
   - Quotient of the numbers

## Example Usage 💻

```bash
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.0
Difference: 8.0
Product: 20.0
Quotient: 5.0
```

## Notes ⚠️

- The calculator uses `float()` to handle decimal numbers.
- Currently doesn't handle division by zero - be sure to enter non-zero as the second number for division!
- Emojis make math more fun! 😎

## Future Improvements 🔮

- Add error handling for division by zero
- Include more operations (exponents, modulus, etc.)
- Create a GUI version
- Add history of calculations

Enjoy calculating! 🎉
